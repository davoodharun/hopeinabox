Then she decides to try out for the part of Charlotte in the fourth grade’s dramatization of Charlotte’s Web. George thinks the play will be a vehicle to let her mom know that she’s really a girl, not a boy. But Charlotte is also the part that she wants because she loves the character. George finally tells her friend Kelly the truth, and after Kelly is cast as Charlotte, she and George conspire to have George play Charlotte in the second performance. By then George has told both her mom and her older brother. Both of them had assumed George was gay, and while George’s brother looks at George as if she finally makes sense to him, George’s mom is struggling.

The support Georges receives from Kelly, from her brother, and from the school principal, as well as the range of responses of others, are all realistic. But all of the characters are more than their responses, just as George is more than her gender. She’s George, a girl with many interests delighting in chances to outwardly express an elemental aspect of her identity.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://ccbc.education.wisc.edu/george/\",\"RowNumber\":61},{\"Title\":\"Hurricane Child\",\"Author\":\"by Kacen Callender\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"1\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"\",\"Yes\":\"1\",\"No\":\"\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"1\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"1\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"1\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"1\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"1\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"1\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"Every morning Caroline Murphy hops on a speedboat and makes the short trip from her home on Water Island to her Catholic school on St. Thomas of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Home isn’t much better: Her mother left Caroline and her father about a year ago, but the tenacious twelve-year-old is determined to find out what happened to her. When a new girl, Kalinda, transfers to Caroline’s school from Barbados, Caroline is immediately drawn to her and determined to make Kalinda her first friend—and possibly more.

Besides, there's something more important to worry about- A ghost is haunting Bug's eerie old house in rural Vermont...and maybe haunting Bug in particular.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/kyle-lukoff/too-bright-to-see/\",\"RowNumber\":73},{\"Title\":\"Rick\",\"Author\":\"by Alex Gino\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"1\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"1\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"Rick's never questioned much.

Not one to easily make friends, 13-year-old Hazel doesn’t plan to get close to anyone when she starts eighth grade at a new school. She just has to keep her head down until high school, when her life will return to normal with her reunion with her longtime best friend. Then one of her moms announces she’s pregnant. Mimi has already had two miscarriages; Hazel, understandably, refuses to be hopeful. She’s determined to live in denial until the new baby is born safe and healthy. Although she has a loving family, two new friends, and a herd of goats to keep her company, nothing is easy. She hopes On the Origin of Species will help her make sense of the changes in her life, but not even Charles Darwin can explain the challenges of growing up. Hazel’s emotional growth—her increasing understanding of who she was, is, and will be—is gradual. Her first-person narration is insightful; she’s highly likable, and her troubles and triumphs will sound familiar to many. Hazel, her biological mother, and her brother are white. The broad diversity among other characters is incorporated naturally: Mimi is black; one new friend, Carina, is a Mexican American trans girl, and another, Yoshi, a cis-boy, is Japanese American and uses a wheelchair.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lisa-jenn-bigelow/hazels-theory-of-evolution/\",\"RowNumber\":76},{\"Title\":\"The Pants Project\",\"Author\":\"by Cat Clark\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"1\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"1\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"1\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"1\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"In a few months, Liv effects a major change in his new middle school’s antiquated dress code while simultaneously acquiring the courage to come out as transgender. From the start, readers are drawn into the story by 11-year-old Liv’s believable, humor-tinged narration: “Little brothers can always be counted on to reach peak levels of annoying at exactly the wrong moment. It must be part of their job description.” Throughout, Liv’s voice is convincing and a pleasure to read. Readers learn that, over the years, Liv has become increasingly less tolerant of being assigned female pronouns and the name “Olivia.” Being required to wear a skirt daily at middle school is the last straw. He—still “she” to others—works to convince the school’s new principal that students should have some choice in clothing, moving from an unsuccessful conversation to an unpromising petition to a brilliantly orchestrated media event. Along the way, he contends with a mean-spirited bully and the loss of a former friend even as he makes new, more loyal friends and wrestles with his own shortcomings. His coming-out to friend Jacob is realistically brief and an enormous relief. Liv’s two moms add further dimension to a tale that unabashedly affirms the importance of accepting and celebrating differences. The book assumes a white default, with ethnicity cued by naming convention.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/cat-clarke/the-pants-project/\",\"RowNumber\":77},{\"Title\":\"The Other Boy\",\"Author\":\"by MG Hennessey\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"1\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"1\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"1\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"1\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"1\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"Twelve-year-old Shane Woods is seriously into baseball, video games, the graphic novel he’s drawing, and a redheaded classmate named Madeline...The white sixth-grader has been inseparable from his Chinese-American best friend, Josh Choi, since they met, but Josh can tell Shane’s distracted by something.

After a tornado destroys her home, her notebook, filled with things Ivy isn’t ready to talk about or trust with anyone, goes missing, and she feels the last bit of her world drop out from under her. The images are telling; there can be no doubt that the white girl with the “coiling mane” of wild strawberry-blonde hair is 12-year-old Ivy or that she’s holding hands with a dark-haired white girl in every picture. When her drawings begin turning up in her school locker, Ivy’s biggest fear comes true: someone knows her secret. The mystery person encourages Ivy to come out, but whom can she trust? Is she even ready? Blake’s (Suffer Love, 2016) first middle-grade novel is characterized by rich, descriptive prose. The tornado scene is filled with breathtaking urgency as Ivy and her family run for safety, and the descriptions of Ivy’s contradictory and confusing feelings capture the heartbreaking difficulty of a non-normative early adolescence filled with questions of identity and belonging. Most characters are assumed white; the black lesbian who owns the inn where the Aberdeens stay after the storm and who steps in as a surrogate mother while Ivy’s own is occupied with insurance and a sick baby, is engaged to a brown-skinned Latina.

The novel's innovative format reveals the \\\"alphabiography\\\" of 13-year-old Joe Bunch, the gay member of the seventh-grade misfits. In this alphabetical survey, assigned by his English teacher, he shares his heartfelt, snappy reflections. For \\\"A is for Addie,\\\" he recalls his earlier years, when he liked to dress up and play with Barbie dolls (a pastime that bonded him to Addie, also from the Gang of Five). He confesses that in fifth grade he wanted to be a \\\"guy-guy\\\" so badly that he asked his friend to teach him how (\\\"Oh. My. God. It was pathetic\\\"). Joe has a crush on \\\"totally cool, smart\\\" Colin (the \\\"C\\\" entry), a jock who returns his affection but is not ready to go public with their relationship and eventually calls it off. Encouraged by his insightful aunt, Joe takes a major leap when he comes out to his supportive family. Howe deals with weighty issues, but uses Joe's affable personality to interject ample humor, and the hero ends each segment with a \\\"Life Lesson,\\\" many presenting principles appropriate to any kid (e.g., \\\"Just be who you are, okay?\\\"). This narrator is anything but an average Joe: he's candid, memorable and—though he might find this hard to believe—totally charismatic.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780689839573\",\"RowNumber\":81},{\"Title\":\"See You At Harry's\",\"Author\":\"by Jo Knowles\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"1\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"1\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"Sit back in a comfortable chair, bring on the Kleenex and cry your heart out. Seventh-grader Fern, in pitch-perfect present tense, relates the dual tragedies of her family. Her high school freshman older brother Holden has come to the place in his life where he’s acknowledged that he’s gay and is taking the first painful, unsteady steps out into a less-than-fully-accepting world. Fern offers him support and love, but what she can give is not always what he needs. Their older sister, Sara, spending a frustrating gap year after high school supposedly helping with the family restaurant, makes life hard for everyone with her critical eye and often unkind comments. And then there’s 3-year-old Charlie, always messy, often annoying, but deeply loved. Fern’s busy, distracted parents leave all of the kids wanting for more attention—until a tragic accident tears the family apart. The pain they experience after the calamity is vividly, agonizingly portrayed and never maudlin. Eventually there are tiny hints of brightness to relieve the gloom: the wisdom of Fern’s friend Ran, the ways that Sara, Fern and Holden find to support each other, and their thoughtfully depicted, ever-so-gradual healing as they rediscover the strength of family. Prescient writing, fully developed characters and completely, tragically believable situations elevate this sad, gripping tale to a must-read level.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jo-knowles/see-you-harrys/\",\"RowNumber\":82},{\"Title\":\"The House You Pass on the Way\",\"Author\":\"by Jacqueline Woodson\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"1\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"1\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"1\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"1\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"1\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"1\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"The middle child in the county's only mixed-race family, Evangeline defiantly changed her name years ago to Staggerlee, after the anti-hero in a ballad, but the finger-pointing has driven her within herself, leaving her friendless and lonely—lonelier still for the memory of the pleasure she took in kissing a girl in grade school. Along comes Trout, another self-named teenager, from a branch of the family that had cut off her parents after their marriage. The attraction is quick, strong, and mutual; Trout's visit may be a short one, but it's long enough for each to open up, find the courage to say the word gay—and to remember that they're only 14, too young to close off options. Woodson takes readers another step down the road when Trout later writes to admit that she's gone head over heels for a guy, and Staggerlee, though feeling betrayed, realizes that she and Trout are both growing and going their own ways.

Tam is a volleyball player sometimes mistaken for a boy. Kate is a popular cheerleader. When they notice each other at seventh grade registration, Tam sees a walking cliché with a perfect ponytail, while Kate sees a girl as “tall as a palm tree.” When they meet face to face, they strike an immediate rapport. Soon the two are having lunch together every day and linking pinkies in the halls. As they grow closer, each finds herself questioning who she thought she was. Tam doesn’t know how she fits into Kate’s seemingly perfect world. Kate, who has spent her life trying to live up to her shallow, perfectionist mother’s expectations, wants to go her own way, a process that includes deciding whether or not to admit her feelings for Tam. Tam and Kate share the first-person narration, which keenly conveys each girl’s joys and inner turmoil. The dual narratives play off of each other, sometimes in a call-and-response manner that clearly communicates the shyness, awkwardness, and confusion of first love. A trio of unseen watchers, identified as Alex, Alyx, and Alexx, collectively represent the observant school-hallway bystanders, providing commentary and speculation in the manner of a Greek chorus. Their verses can be read vertically or horizontally, resulting in multiple meanings. Characters are racially ambiguous.

Counting down the days until an experimental Procedure might free him (possibly fatally) from the alien bond that has made movement and speech painfully difficult for 10 years, the white eighth-grader chronicles the quirks of his loving family, his passion for drawing and writing, his run-ins with bullies, and his awkward crush on another boy at school. Meanwhile Zyx (typing through Felix’s fingers) provides running commentary as something of a “wise fool” archetype, dispensing gnomic truths and mystical insight with the eager charm of a hyperintelligent puppy. But the outré premise is only the setup for this unique, whimsical tale; it’s also about webcomics and chess and geometry and jazz and the astonishing “threeness of things.” It’s about the suffocating terror of death and the sweet agony of first love. It’s about transcending binaries, both the obvious—Felix’s mother is bisexual, his grandparent gender-fluid, the boy of his dreams both biracial (black/white) and bilingual—and those more subtle and profound, all in the most gloriously matter-of-fact way. Above all, it’s about Felix’s voice: acutely perceptive, disarmingly witty, devastatingly honest, and utterly captivating. Joyful, heartbreaking, completely bonkers, and exuberantly alive.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lisa-bunker/felix-yz/\",\"RowNumber\":90},{\"Title\":\"In the Key of Us \",\"Author\":\"by Mariama J.

This inspiring, celebratory book honors Haring’s life and art, along with his very special connection with kids. “I would love to be a teacher because I love children and I think that not enough people respect children or understand how important they are.” —Keith Haring. \\n\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/drawing-on-walls-a-story-of-keith-haring\",\"RowNumber\":108},{\"Title\":\"Things We Couldn't Say \\n\",\"Author\":\"by Jay Coles\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"1\",\"Early high school\":\"1\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"1\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"1\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"1\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"1\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"There's always been a hole in Gio's life.

Editor and contributor Carpenter states her intention to present an alternative to the idea of rural America as a monolith, one that is frequently regarded with mockery and contempt. Featuring stories set in 12 states, the tales’ formats include verse, graphic novel, memoir, as well as prose. Locales range from the southern and western sections of the country to Alaska and upstate New York. The teen protagonists, like the contributors, come from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, and issues of class emerge in surprising ways. Some characters grapple with ideas about who they are in relation to their environments while others are clear about what they gain from their rural identities. The strength of the collection is how well it demonstrates the universality of themes such as belonging, family struggles, grief, the desire for individual growth, the meaning of home, and challenging injustice. At the same time, cultural specificity is highlighted and celebrated. The compilation successfully meets the challenge of serving as a cohesive whole while providing readers with enough variety of tone, pace, and voice to keep the reading experience interesting. A fresh and highly accessible contribution.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/nora-shalaway-carpenter/rural-voices/\",\"RowNumber\":117},{\"Title\":\"Pet\",\"Author\":\"by Akwaeke Emezi\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"1\",\"Late high school\":\"\",\"Yes\":\"1\",\"No\":\"\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"1\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"1\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"1\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"Teenager Jam unwittingly animates her mother’s painting, summoning a being through a cross-dimensional portal.

Selvadurai's protagonist and narrator is Arjun (\\\"Arjie\\\") Chelvaratnam, the second son of a prosperous Tamil family who cast a common disapproving eye on Arjie's avoidance of other boys and their games, and on his disturbing preference for playing \\\"bride- bride\\\" with the neighborhood girls and trying on his favorite aunt's clothing and makeup. Arjie's emotional passage—through both a fractious boyhood and a culture marked by ethnic conflict and recurring violence—is charted in a series of elaborately developed extended episodes that Selvadurai handles with an almost casual mastery. Such episodes include Arjie's hilarious confrontation with a stentorian playmate and rival (whom he mockingly titles \\\"Her Fatness\\\"); his fascinated observation of a young aunt's foredoomed flirtation with a young man their family can't accept; his incipient crush on a handsome young family employee; and eventually his experiences at a Dickensian boarding school, where he discovers both sex and the courage to defy the abuses practiced by those who wield arbitrary power (\\\"How was it that some people got to decide what was correct or not, just or unjust?\\\"). Selvadurai can make family squabbles resonate with almost epic force and weight, and his beautifully manipulated plot powerfully expresses the manifold connections among familial, political, and sexual identity and destiny. Arjie himself is only the most appealing of a dozen or more generously observed and vividly rendered characters. And, almost as an incidental bonus, the novel delicately, knowingly records the subtlest permutations of mistrust and contention among Sri Lanka's Sinhalese (Buddhist) and Tamil (Hindu) populace. First-rate fiction, from a brilliant new writer whose next book cannot arrive here quickly enough.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/shyam-selvadurai/funny-boy/\",\"RowNumber\":126},{\"Title\":\"We Are Okay\",\"Author\":\"by Nina LaCour\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"1\",\"Early high school\":\"1\",\"Late high school\":\"\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"1\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"1\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"“If only lonely were a more accurate word.

Her single respite will be a brief visit from her best friend, Mabel. Marin is dreading the stay for reasons that are revealed in flashbacks: she fled San Francisco without informing anyone after the sudden death of her beloved Gramps, who raised her. Over the course of three days, secrets about Gramps, Marin’s long-dead mother, and the girls’ complicated relationship are revealed in short, exquisite sentences that evoke myriad emotions with a minimum of words. “I must have shut grief out. Found it in books. Cried over fiction instead of the truth. The truth was unconfined, unadorned. There was no poetic language to it, no yellow butterflies, no epic floods.…The truth was vast enough to drown in.” A surprise arrival at story’s end leads to a tearful resolution of Marin’s sorrow and a heartfelt renewal of her relationship with Mabel and her family. Mexican-American Mabel speaks Spanish, while an absence of markers indicates Marin is likely white.

His former classmate Lisa, ambitious to a fault (\\\"You're like Lady Macbeth without the murder\\\" says her boyfriend, Clark), has long wondered what became of him and angles her way into his life. She begins to visit Solomon daily and is surprised at how funny and easygoing he is, eventually bringing into the fold a reluctant Clark, who quickly bonds with him. In part because Solomon has earlier come out as gay to her, this eventually piques Lisa's jealousy and sets the stage for a heartbreaking clash among the three.

Though Bechdel (known for her syndicated “Dykes to Watch Out For” strip and collections) takes her formal cues from comic books, she receives more inspiration from the likes of Proust and Joyce as she attempts to unravel the knots of her family’s twisted emotional history. At the core of this compelling narrative is her relationship with her father, a literary-minded high-school teacher who restores and runs the familial funeral parlor. (It is also the family’s residence and the “fun home” of the title.) Beneath his icy reserve and fussy perfectionism, he is a barely closeted homosexual and a suspected pedophile, an imposing but distant presence to his young daughter, who finds that their main bond is a shared literary sensibility. As she comes of age as an artist and comes to terms with her own sexual identity, Bechdel must also deal with the dissolution of her parents’ marriage and, soon afterward, her father’s death. Was it an accident or was it suicide? How did her father’s sexuality shape her own? Rather than proceeding in chronological fashion, the memoir keeps circling back to this central relationship and familial tragedy, an obsession that the artist can never quite resolve or shake. The results are painfully honest, occasionally funny and penetratingly insightful. Feminists, lesbians and fans of underground comics will enthusiastically embrace this major advance in Bechdel’s work, which should significantly extend both her renown and her readership. Though this will likely be stocked with graphic novels, it shares as much in spirit with the work of Mary Karr, Tobias Wolff and other contemporary memoirists of considerable literary accomplishment.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alison-bechdel/fun-home/\",\"RowNumber\":161},{\"Title\":\"The Hours\",\"Author\":\"Michael Cunningham\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"1\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"1\",\"Synopsis\":\"Steeped in the work and life of Virginia Woolf, Cunningham (Flesh and Blood, 1995, etc.) offers up a sequel to the work of the great author, complete with her own pathos and brilliance. Cunningham tells three tales, interweaving them in cunning ways and, after the model of Mrs. Dalloway itself, allowing each only a day in the life of its central character. First comes Woolf herself, in June of 1923 (after a prologue describing her 1941 suicide). In Woolf’s day (as in her writings), little “happens,” though the profundities are great: Virginia works (on Mrs. Dalloway); her sister Vanessa visits; Virginia holds her madness at bay (just barely); and, over dinner, she convinces husband Leonard to move back to London from suburban Richmond. In the “Mrs. Brown” sections, a young woman named Sally Brown reads the novel Mrs. Dalloway, this in suburban L.A. (in 1949), where Sally has a three-year-old son, is pregnant again, and, preparing her husband’s birthday celebration, fights off her own powerful despair. Finally, and at greatest length, is the present-time day in June of “Mrs. Dalloway,” this being one Clarissa Vaughan of West 10th Street, NYC, years ago nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by her then-lover and now-AIDS-victim Richard Brown—who, on this day in June, is to receive a major prize for poetry. Like the original Mrs. Dalloway, this Clarissa is planning a party (for Richard), goes out for flowers, observes the day, sees someone famous, thinks about life, time, the past, and love (“Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other”). Much in fact does happen; much is lost, hoped for, feared, sometimes recovered (“It will serve as this afternoon’s manifestation of the central mystery itself”), all in gorgeous, Woolfian, shimmering, perfectly-observed prose.

Cam is 12 when readers first meet her, but several years pass over the course of the book's nearly 500 pages. Carefully crafted symbols—a dollhouse into which Cam puts stolen trinkets and mementos, the lake where her mother once escaped disaster only to die there 30 years later—provide a backbone for the story's ever-shifting array of characters and episodes, each rendered in vibrant, almost memoirlike detail. The tense relationship between Cam's sexuality and her family and community's religious beliefs is handled with particular nuance, as are her romantic and sexual entanglements, from a summer fling with an out, proud and smug Seattlite to an all-encompassing love for a seemingly straight female friend. Even when events take a dark and gut-punchingly inevitable turn, the novel remains at its heart a story of survival and of carving out space even in a world that wants one's annihilation. Rich with detail and emotion, a sophisticated read for teens and adults alike.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/emily-m-danforth/miseducation-cameron-post/\",\"RowNumber\":163},{\"Title\":\"The Laramie Project \",\"Author\":\"Moisés Kaufman\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"1\",\"No\":\"\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"1\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"1\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"1\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"1\",\"Classics\":\"1\",\"Synopsis\":\"For a year and a half following the murder of Matthew Shepard, Moisés Kaufman and his Tectonic Theater Project–whose previous play, Gross Indecency, was hailed as a work of unsurpassed originality–conducted hundreds of interviews with the citizens of Laramie, Wyoming, to create this portrait of a town struggling with a horrific event. The savage killing of Shepard, a young gay man, has become a national symbol of the struggle against intolerance.

Rothman-Zecher’s debut begins in the “fluorescent glow of a jail cell” just days after its narrator’s 19th birthday. In an epistolary narrative addressed to his friend Laith, Jonathan pours out his heart and sorts through his past. Two years earlier, before his senior year of high school, Jonathan’s family returned to Israel after a long stint in Pennsylvania. The family’s history—his grandfather left the Greek city of Salonica before the Nazis deported all its Jews to concentration camps; other family members did not—has given Jonathan a profound sense of the importance of the Jewish state. Thus he was eagerly awaiting the beginning of his military service when he met Laith and his sister, Nimreen, tall, brilliant, cool Palestinian twins, students at Haifa University, both with eyes “the color of a sidewalk after a misty summer rain.” Charmed and amused by the boy and his really pretty decent command of Arabic, they take him under their wings, and all more or less fall in love with each other. Over a long series of adventures, bus trips, nights on the beach, marijuana-fueled conversations, and poetry readings, Jonathan begins to see the occupation through the eyes of his friends and grasps that their family history is no less tragic than his own. Then his draft date arrives, and before long his unit is sent as a police presence to a demonstration in the Territories. “Today, you’re going to put down a riot,” their commander says. What happens that day is the reason Jonathan is in jail, the reason for this cri de coeur to his beloved friend Laith. A passionate, poetic coming-of-age story set in a mine field, brilliantly capturing the intensity of feeling on both sides of the conflict.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/moriel-rothman-zecher/sadness-is-a-white-bird/\",\"RowNumber\":167},{\"Title\":\"If I Was Your Girl\",\"Author\":\"Meredith Russo\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"1\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"1\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"In an illuminating debut guided by hope and overwhelming kindness, Russo demonstrates the challenges teens face in finding “the truest version” of themselves. Though she was born Andrew Hardy, Amanda always knew she was meant to be a girl. After enduring classroom bullies and her father’s admonishments to toughen up, Amanda moves to Atlanta with her mother for a long, difficult physical transition. Afterward, Amanda returns to her father and a new town in Tennessee, eager to finish high school and move to a big city. Amanda wishes to go unnoticed, but her beauty attracts friends and potential boyfriends. The more she begins to feel like “a normal teenage girl,” the more she becomes aware of the secrets those around her keep—secrets that, like hers, have the power to both destroy and liberate. Shifting between Amanda’s past and present, Russo gently examines the emotional journey of one trans teen, covering acceptable language, gender expectations, and the politics of going “stealth.” Though the Southern setting and religious undertones aren’t free of stereotypes, they serve as a sounding board for larger issues of identity and orientation.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/9781250078407\",\"RowNumber\":168},{\"Title\":\"The Color Purple\",\"Author\":\"Alice Walker\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"1\",\"No\":\"\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"1\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"1\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"1\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"1\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"1\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"1\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"1\",\"Synopsis\":\"A powerful cultural touchstone of modern American literature, The Color Purple depicts the lives of African American women in early twentieth-century rural Georgia.

National Book Award winner Woodson (Harbor Me, 2018, etc.) returns to her cherished Brooklyn, its “cardinals and flowers and bright-colored cars. Little girls with purple ribbons and old women with swollen ankles.” For her latest coming-of-age story, Woodson opens in the voice of Melody, waiting on the interior stairs of her grandparents’ brownstone. She’s 16, making her debut, a “ritual of marking class and time and transition.” She insists that the assembled musicians play Prince’s risqué “Darling Nikki” as she descends. Melody jabs at her mother, Iris, saying “It’s Prince. And it’s my ceremony and he’s a genius so why are we even still talking about it? You already nixed the words. Let me at least have the music.” Woodson famously nails the adolescent voice. But so, too, she burnishes all her characters’ perspectives. Iris’ sexual yearning for another girl at Oberlin College gives this novel its title: “She felt red at the bone—like there was something inside of her undone and bleeding.” By then, Iris had all but abandoned toddler Melody and the toddler’s father, Aubrey, in that ancestral brownstone to make her own way. In 21 lyrical chapters, readers hear from both of Iris’ parents, who met at Morehouse, and Aubrey’s mother, CathyMarie, who stretched the margarine and grape jelly sandwiches to see him grown. Woodson’s ear for music—whether Walt Whitman's or A Tribe Called Quest's—is exhilarating, as is her eye for detail. Aubrey and little Melody, holding hands, listen to an old man whose “bottom dentures were loose in his mouth, moving in small circles as he spoke.” The novel itself circles elegantly back to its beginning, Melody and Iris in 2001 for a brava finale, but not before braiding the 1921 Race Massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the fires of 9/11. The thread is held by Iris’ mother, Sabe, who hangs on through her fatal illness “a little while longer. Until Melody and Iris can figure each other out.” In Woodson, at the height of her powers, readers hear the blues: “beneath that joy, such a sadness.”\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jacqueline-woodson/red-at-the-bone/\",\"RowNumber\":171},{\"Title\":\"Mrs. Dalloway\",\"Author\":\"Virginia Woolf\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"1\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"1\",\"Synopsis\":\"Heralded as Virginia Woolf's greatest novel, this is a vivid portrait of a single day in a woman's life.

They are all more or less good ones. Ijeawele must be a full person and not let motherhood alone define her; she should go back to work if she wants to, and love “the confidence and self-fulfilment that come with doing and earning”. She should share childcare equally, and not thank her husband for changing their daughter’s nappy – nor complain about the way he does it, either. They should never tell their daughter not to do something “because she’s a girl”; they shouldn’t encourage her to aim at getting married, as if it were an achievement in itself.

If so, Eugenides (The Virgin Suicides) is ahead of the game. His beautifully written novel begins: \\\"Specialized readers may have come across me in Dr. Peter Luce's study, 'Gender Identity in 5-Alpha-Reductase Pseudohermaphrodites.' \\\"The \\\"me\\\" of that sentence, \\\"Cal\\\" Stephanides, narrates his story of sexual shifts with exemplary tact, beginning with his immigrant grandparents, Desdemona and Lefty. On board the ship taking them from war-torn Turkey to America, they married—but they were brother and sister. Eugenides spends the book's first half recreating, with a fine-grained density, the Detroit of the 1920s and '30s where the immigrants settled: Ford car factories and the tiny, incipient sect of Black Muslims. Then comes Cal's story, which is necessarily interwoven with his parents' upward social trajectory. Milton, his father, takes an insurance windfall and parlays it into a fast-food hotdog empire. Meanwhile, Tessie, his wife, gives birth to a son and then a daughter—or at least, what seems to be a female baby. Genetics meets medical incompetence meets history, and Callie is left to think of her \\\"crocus\\\" as simply unusually long—until she reaches the age of 14. Eugenides, like Rick Moody, has an extraordinary sensitivity to the mores of our leafier suburbs, and Cal's gender confusion is blended with the story of her first love, Milton's growing political resentments and the general shedding of ethnic habits. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about this book is Eugenides's ability to feel his way into the girl, Callie, and the man, Cal. It's difficult to imagine any serious male writer of earlier eras so effortlessly transcending the stereotypes of gender. This is one determinedly literary novel that should also appeal to a large, general audience.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/0374199698\",\"Awards\":\"Pulitzer Prize\",\"RowNumber\":175},{\"Title\":\"For Today I Am A Boy\",\"Author\":\"Kim Fu\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"1\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"1\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"1\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"A young man wrestles with gender expectations and his own gender identity in this quietly forceful debut from the Seattle-based author. Growing up in exurban Ontario, Peter was always the outlier, preferring his three sisters’ girlish behavior over that of his rough-and-tumble male classmates. But his attempts to push his boyishness aside—cooking while wearing a much-loved apron, for instance—incur the wrath of his father, a conservative Chinese immigrant. As his sisters move away, Peter fends for himself in Montreal, taking odd restaurant jobs that give him a small supportive tribe and an opportunity to make sense of his sexuality. While the book has its share of clashes with bigotry, its strength is in its interiority: Fu subtly and poetically evokes the intensity of need her narrator feels to become female. (“What would turn me into them?” Peter thinks, watching a group of women at a nightclub. “Could I peel it all off their faces and bodies with a paint trowel and spread it over my surface?”) Peter’s gender anxiety inevitably leads him down frustrating paths, such as one affair with a middle-aged woman whose domination turns abusive and another with a woman who’s futilely trying to submerge her lesbianism through an ex-gay ministry. Yet Fu is skilled at capturing feelings of rootlessness that go beyond gender, encompassing Peter's immigrant-son status and distance from his family. All of Peter’s emotional baggage makes the novel tonally somber, but Peter’s search for a sense of normalcy—to finally become his female self—has a redemptive trajectory that feels fully earned. A study of transexuality that’s shot through with melancholy while capturing the bliss of discovering one’s sexual self.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/kim-fu/for-today-i-am-a-boy/\",\"RowNumber\":176},{\"Title\":\"Less\",\"Author\":\"Andrew Greer\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"1\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"Facing his erstwhile boyfriend’s wedding to another man, his 50th birthday, and his publisher’s rejection of his latest manuscript, a miserable midlist novelist heads for the airport. When it comes to the literary canon, Arthur Less knows he is “as superfluous as the extra a in quaalude,” but he does get the odd invitation—to interview a more successful author, to receive an obscure prize, to tour French provincial libraries, that sort of thing. So rather than stay in San Francisco and be humiliated when his younger man of nine years' standing marries someone else (he can’t bear to attend, nor can he bear to stay home), he puts together a patchwork busman’s holiday that will take him to Paris, Morocco, Berlin, Southern India, and Japan. Of course, anything that can go wrong does—from falling out a window to having his favorite suit eaten by a stray dog, and as far as Less runs, he will not escape the fact that he really did lose the love of his life. Meanwhile, there’s no way to stop that dreaded birthday, which he sees as the definitive end of a rather extended youth: “It’s like the last day in a foreign country. You finally figure out where to get coffee, and drinks, and a good steak. And then you have to leave. And you won’t ever be back.” Yet even this conversation occurs in the midst of a make-out session with a handsome Spanish stranger on a balcony at a party in Paris…hinting that there may be steaks and coffee on the other side. Upping the tension of this literary picaresque is the fact that the story is told by a mysterious narrator whose identity and role in Less’ future is not revealed until the final pages. Seasoned novelist Greer (The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells, 2013, etc.) clearly knows whereof he speaks and has lived to joke about it. Nonstop puns on the character’s surname aside, this is a very funny and occasionally wise book.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/andrew-sean-greer/less/\",\"RowNumber\":177},{\"Title\":\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\",\"Author\":\"Carson McCullers\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"1\",\"Gay\":\"1\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"1\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"1\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"1\",\"Coming out\":\"\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"1\",\"Synopsis\":\"Carson McCullers’ prodigious first novel was published to instant acclaim when she was just twenty-three.

Many of the 27 short essays collected here (which appeared originally in the New Yorker, Esquire and elsewhere) deal with his father, Lou, to whom the book is dedicated. Lou is a micromanager who tries to get his uninterested children to form a jazz combo and, when that fails, insists on boosting David's career as a performance artist by heckling him from the audience. Sedaris suggests that his father's punishment for being overly involved in his kids' artistic lives is David's brother Paul, otherwise known as \\\"The Rooster,\\\" a half-literate miscreant whose language is outrageously profane. Sedaris also writes here about the time he spent in France and the difficulty of learning another language. After several extended stays in a little Norman village and in Paris, Sedaris had progressed, he observes, \\\"from speaking like an evil baby to speaking like a hillbilly. `Is thems the thoughts of cows?' I'd ask the butcher, pointing to the calves' brains displayed in the front window.\\\" But in English, Sedaris is nothing if not nimble: in one essay he goes from his cat's cremation to his mother's in a way that somehow manages to remain reverent to both of the departed. \\\"Reliable sources\\\" have told Sedaris that he has \\\"tended to exhaust people,\\\" and true to form, he will exhaust readers of this new book, too, with helpless laughter.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780316777728\",\"RowNumber\":179},{\"Title\":\"We the Animals\",\"Author\":\"Justin Torres\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"1\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"1\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"An exquisite, blistering debut novel. Three brothers tear their way through childhood — smashing tomatoes all over each other, building kites from trash, hiding out when their parents do battle, tiptoeing around the house as their mother sleeps off her graveyard shift. Paps and Ma are from Brooklyn — he’s Puerto Rican, she’s white — and their love is a serious, dangerous thing that makes and unmakes a family many times. Life in this family is fierce and absorbing, full of chaos and heartbreak and the euphoria of belonging completely to one another. From the intense familial unity felt by a child to the profound alienation he endures as he begins to see the world, this beautiful novel reinvents the coming-of-age story in a way that is sly and punch-in-the-stomach powerful.

From a few lines in The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book, Truong reimagines the Vietnamese cook who was hired by the famous residents at 27 rue de Fleurus. Bình, as he calls himself, is an exile from his homeland, where he was denounced because of a homosexual relationship and banished by his brutal father. After three years at sea, Bình ends up in Paris, where he answers Toklas's ad (\\\"Two American ladies wish...\\\") and enters the household of Gertrude Stein. The story begins in 1934 when the women he calls \\\"my Mesdames\\\" are about to tour America, and Bình fears he'll be cast adrift once again. Flashbacks reveal his loneliness and guilt, his doomed love affairs (he enjoys a brief tryst with Ho Chi Minh, whom he knows only as \\\"the man on the bridge\\\") and his sadness at having abandoned his mother and his native land. The tone throughout is poignant, lightened by Bình's subversive wit; for all his bitterness and resentment, he is a captivating narrator, as adept at describing Stein's literary salon as the contents of Toklas's kitchen. If Truong sometimes stretches the range of Bình's understanding and powers of observation, interpreting even the thoughts of Stein herself, the narrative rings with emotional authenticity. Truong's supple prose is permeated with sensual detail, reminiscent of A Debt to Pleasure in its evocation of the erotic possibilities of food. But it is her intuitive understanding of the condition of exile—\\\"the pure, sea salt sadness of the outcast\\\"—that infuses her novel with richness and beauty.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780618304004\",\"RowNumber\":181},{\"Title\":\"Drowning in Fire\",\"Author\":\"Craig Womack\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"1\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"1\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"1\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"1\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"As a young boy growing up within the Muskogee Creek Nation in rural Oklahoma, Josh experiences a yearning for something he cannot tame. Quiet and skinny and shy, he feels out of place, at once inflamed and ashamed by his attraction to other boys. Driven by a need to understand himself and his history, Josh struggles to reconcile the conflicting voices he hears—from the messages of sin and scorn of the non-Indian Christian churches his parents attend in order to assimilate, to the powerful stories of his older Creek relatives, which have been the center of his upbringing, memory, and ongoing experience. In his fevered and passionate dreams, Josh catches a glimpse of something that makes the Muskogee Creek world come alive. Lifted by his great-aunt Lucille’s tales of her own wild girlhood, Josh learns to fly back through time, to relive his people’s history, and uncover a hidden legacy of triumphs and betrayals, ceremonies and secrets he can forge into a new sense of himself. When as a man, Josh rediscovers the boyhood friend who first stirred his desires, he realizes a transcendent love that helps take him even deeper into the Creek world he has explored all along in his imagination. Interweaving past and present, history and story, explicit realism and dreamlike visions, Craig Womack’s Drowning in Fire explores a young man’s journey to understand his cultural and sexual identity within a framework drawn from the community of his origins. A groundbreaking and provocative coming-of-age story, Drowning in Fire is a vividly realized novel by an impressive literary talent.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/589425.Drowning_in_Fire?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=fdlmkbeFWv&rank=1\",\"RowNumber\":182},{\"Title\":\"The Prophets\",\"Author\":\"Robert Jones, Jr.\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"1\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"1\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"1\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"1\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"1\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"1\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"1\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"1\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"1\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"An epic attempt to imagine a history of Black queerness from the African past to the antebellum American South. In his debut novel, Jones—perhaps better known to readers as the blogger Son of Baldwin—delivers an ambitious tale of love and beauty in the face of brutality. Samuel and Isaiah are two young men enslaved on a Mississippi plantation known as Empty. Isaiah is haunted by fragmented memories of the mother he was stripped from as a child; Samuel became Isaiah's first friend on the plantation when he was brought there in chains, and their relationship has bloomed into a love affair that sets them apart from the other slaves and disrupts the plantation's functioning. The plantation's owner is Paul, a White man who forces his slaves into having sex so the women will produce new slaves. Samuel’s and Isaiah's sexuality throws a wrench in Paul's cruelty, and the consequences of their love send ripples through the novel's vast cast of vividly rendered characters. There's Essie, for instance, the female slave Isaiah can't impregnate and who eventually is raped by Paul. She becomes pregnant with Solomon—whom she can't bring herself to love—and this infuriates Amos, an older slave who loves her and schemes to turn the plantation against Isaiah and Samuel for what he thinks of not only as their selfishness, but their unnatural love. \\\"There was no suitable name for whatever it was that Samuel and Isaiah were doing,\\\" he reflects after seeing them coiled together in the barn they share. Jones spins a sprawling story of jealousy and passion that foregrounds Black queerness, asserting that queerness has always been part of the Black experience—not just in the slave past, but the African one as well. The novel stretches itself to the point of disbelief when Jones dips his toe into that African past, and there are too many balls in the air for the details of life on Empty to cohere into a satisfying plot. For all its faults, though, this is an inspired and important debut. An ambitious, imaginative, and important tale of Black queerness through history.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-jones-jr/the-prophets-jones/\",\"Awards\":\"National Book Award Finalist\",\"RowNumber\":183},{\"Title\":\"What They Always Tell Us\",\"Author\":\"Martin Wilson\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"1\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"\",\"No\":\"1\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"1\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"1\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"\",\"Synopsis\":\"Set in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Wilson's searching debut maintains a level of urgency as it explores the bonds between two brothers.

But James isn't all that connected to his emotions: when first met, he's in a motel room with a girlfriend and has had sex with her, but is “filled with a strong desire to be rid of her, for good.

Ijeoma’s father, Uzo, is dead, destroyed in a bombing raid that nearly decimated their village, and her mother is quickly unraveling, unable to cope with the ongoing war and famine. But Adaora’s love for her daughter is limitless; when Ijeoma was born early, for example, Adaora gave herself headaches learning about nutrition to make sure her baby grew healthy. Okparanta is masterful at articulating the pressures living through endless violence has on each of her characters' psyches; Adaora crumbles under the harshness of the ongoing war. Her plan is to go to her parents’ house in Aba and see if things are better there while Ijeoma stays with friends in Nnewi; she'll send for the girl to join her when it's safe. But Ijeoma feels this separation is prompted less by necessity than by the fact that Adaora now finds her daughter an impossible burden. Alone in Nnewi, Ijeoma falls in love with another displaced girl, Amina. But when their relationship is discovered, Ijeoma is sent back to her mother, who is determined to teach Ijeoma that two girls can't be romantically involved. In the years following, Ijeoma must reconcile her feelings toward women with the pressure to marry a man and be accepted in a country that makes being gay punishable by death. In language both sparse and lyrical, Okparanta manages to articulate a child's wide-eyed understanding of the breakdown of the world around her. We see, too, a detailed rebuilding of that world along with Ijeoma's maturity into womanhood. Here is writing rich in the beautiful intimacies of people who love each other—and wise about the importance of holding onto those precious connections in a world that is, more often than not, dangerous and cold. Written with courage and compassion, this debut novel by Okparanta (Happiness, Like Water, 2013) stunningly captures a young girl’s coming of age against the backdrop of a nation at war.\",\"Synopsis link\":\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/chinelo-okparanta/under-the-udala-trees/\",\"RowNumber\":185},{\"Title\":\"The Song of Achilles\",\"Author\":\"Madeline Miller\",\"Early elementary\":\"\",\"Late elementary\":\"\",\"Middle school\":\"\",\"Early high school\":\"\",\"Late high school\":\"1\",\"Yes\":\"1\",\"No\":\"\",\"Picture book\":\"\",\"Chapter book\":\"1\",\"Graphic novel\":\"\",\"Non-fiction\":\"\",\"Anthology\":\"\",\"Poetry\":\"\",\"Scripts & plays\":\"\",\"Lesbian\":\"\",\"Gay\":\"1\",\"Bisexual & Pansexual\":\"\",\"Trans & Nonbinary\":\"\",\"Queer+\":\"\",\"Small Town, Rural & Heartland\":\"\",\"Black, Caribbean, & African Diaspora\":\"\",\"Asian & Asian Diaspora\":\"\",\"Latino & Hispanic\":\"\",\"Native American & Indigenous\":\"\",\"Diverse ensemble\":\"\",\"Ability\":\"\",\"Coming out\":\"1\",\"Religion & Spirituality\":\"1\",\"Diverse family structure\":\"\",\"Relationships: Family\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Love\":\"1\",\"Relationships: Friends\":\"\",\"Relationships: Community\":\"\",\"Politics, Society, & Activism\":\"\",\"Classics\":\"1\",\"Synopsis\":\"Achilles, \\\"the best of all the Greeks,\\\" son of the cruel sea goddess Thetis and the legendary king Peleus, is strong, swift, and beautiful, irresistible to all who meet him.
